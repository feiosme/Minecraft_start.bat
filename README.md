# Minecraft_start.bat
Better start.bat
<p>
	What is this?<br />
<br />
As more and more minecraft servers are running, the startup scripts of the server side have always been very primitive, and the functions only stay on the startup. I believe that the server owners need more functions on this startup script, so I wrote a better start.bat.
</p>
<p>
	It support all servers started via start.bat
